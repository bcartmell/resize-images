# Resize Images

A simple utility to find all images in a folder and resize them to a specified
size using imagemagick.

Built so that I could easily make thumbnails for my resume site. I'm sure
something to solve the same problem exists already, but I wanted to build one for
my own purpose.

usage:

    node ./index.js path/to/source/folder path/to/destination/folder [sizeX]x[sizeY]
